No, I am not a writer. For many years u fantasised about the idea of bro g one though. I read books and many articles about the art of writing. But that didn’t make me one.

I tried to do some writing all those years. But all I got were drafts of ideas that I could never take to competition.

The thing is, I was trying too hard. Trying to make every sentence good. Thinking about how it should be. Rather than just letting it be.

This year I decided that trying to be a writer was not for me. And that I should instead write down the things I learn and think about. No pressure at all about the quality or quantity. Just write some things down and be done with it when it’s over.

And guess what, I’m writing in regular basis now. At least once a week. And it feels great. For example, I wrote these notes on my phone at the beach. No need for any fancy setup to get it done either.

I might not become a writer. But writing will be part of my life. And that suits me just fine. As it turns out, the secret has always been: do as you intend to be. Simple as that.
