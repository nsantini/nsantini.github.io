A couple of months ago I started to work on being more self aware. Specifically to figure out what things triggers me into bad moods. And what other behaviours and reactions hindered my life. Both at work and personally.

I noticed two apparently opposite types of behaviours. On one hand, I can get distracted when I’m trying to do something, and her side tracked with other things. In the other, I get very frustrated if I get interrupted when I’m trying to focus on something. What’s up with that!

How can these two seemingly contradictory traits affect me as they do? Maybe they are bit contradictory at all, but two sides of the same coin. It what do I know. I’m not an expert in these matters.

What I noticed about my sidetracking and distractions is that they are worse the less committed I am to the original task. And my annoyance at being disrupted grows with my level of interest in the task at hand.

So maybe they are one and the same. I just want to do what I want to do and not get bugged by other things.

But seriously. My intention with the whole self awareness was to find ways to improve. So now that I have those leads, I need to find things to do to help myself.

I don’t mind getting sidetracked much. Except when the things I forget to do affect my family. Maybe it was something u was supposed to do to help them and I dropped the ball. That’s not good. So I need to be more diligent about following through with what I meant to do. Maybe keeping those tasks written down would help. I will try that.

The harder one to deal with is my challenge with being disrupted. It’s like a knee jerk reaction. I really struggle to hold it back even a bit. I think what I will try is taking a few breaths and a few seconds before reacting. Make it a habit. So that I can put down what I was doing and refocus on what’s happening around me.

These are my intentions. And I will keep working on my self awareness and keep track of my progress, or lack of, to be the best I can possibly be.
