<p>Its been a rough summer, with some frightening moments.</p>
<p>Baby girl's growth slowed down significantly over the last two months. Which is not a good thing.
As a consequence, we've been having checks and scans every week. It all lead to a weekend at hospital.</p>
<p>Furtunately it all went well. And with Nicole stopping work completely, the last week things got better. Baby is moving normally again. And we hope for some good growth in next week's scan.</>
<p>What hasn't change is the end plan. We were hopping for a natural birth using a pool. But that's not going to be possible. Instead it will be an induced birth at 38 weeks (thats 3 weeks away), with a chance of a cesarean.</p>
<p>We are optimistic about the future and, after a bit of a scare last weekend, we feel more relaxed. Is all a case of keeping a close eye for distress signals, resting and eating well, and hope for the best.</p>
