As the old say curses, we are living in "interesting times". Although the word "interesting" seems like a cruel way to describe them. Given how many people are suffering from what the ruling classes are doing across the globe.

We try to keep up with news and be aware of what is going on across the world. But right now its almost impossible to do so and keep a level of mental health. There is too much noise.

Even the local news in good old small New Zealand are going haywire. Every right wing leaning government is applying the "flood the space with shit" approach. Drowning us with rubbish and too many things to focus on. Preventing us to properly evaluate and understand what they are really trying to achieve. A deliberate approach to undermine public response. Divide and conquer. But what they are dividing is our attention, and our ability to act accordingly.

We can't completely turn our backs to what is going on. But we can adapt our approach to be informed to not lose our minds in the process. The key will be to identify and use good sources of information, that present the facts in a way that is adequate for our ways of learning, and that don't overload us with minute details.

That's what the daily news cycle on TV were supposed to do. But more and more I find that I cannot trust them to a) tell the truth, and b) cover the things that matter (to me) the most.

I also find long form journalism hard to absorb. I need things to be presented more concise. Not to skip important aspects of the issue. But also not overly detailed and long.

Finding, and supporting, those journalist whose work fit my needs is the key here. It's hard work. But the alternative is to be taken for a ride by those whose interests are not necessarily mine.

And that is the takeaway, there is no "free lunch". We all have to choose how we want to live these interesting times. Doing the work to be well informed and try to make this a better place. Or be taken for a ride and hope for the best.

There is too much noise. But that is not an excuse to burry our heads in the ground. It's time to take control of our most precious assets, our time and attention.
