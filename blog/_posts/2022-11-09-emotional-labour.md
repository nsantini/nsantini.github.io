Lately, I've discovered that one of the biggest challenges of being a leader is the Emotional Labour involved. Emotional labour refers to the effort and energy that leaders put into managing their own emotions and the emotions of those around them. This can include tasks such as maintaining a positive attitude, providing support to team members, resolving conflicts, and managing stress. We work hard to create a Safe Environment where people can thrive on. We look for opportunities for team members to grow. We discuss and help solve interpersonal issues in our teams. Etc.

One of the main challenges of emotional labour is that it can be draining and exhausting for leaders. They may feel overwhelmed by the emotional demands of their job and struggle to maintain their own well-being. Additionally, emotional labour often goes unnoticed or undervalued, which can lead to burnout and dissatisfaction.

This leaves us drained of Emotional Energy. So when we switch off from work to home mode, we are out of energy to be empathetic and caring at home. This leads to arguments and struggles if we don't keep ourselves in check.

To address this challenge, leaders need to prioritize self-care and seek support from others. They may also need to develop strategies for managing their emotions more effectively, such as mindfulness practices or regular exercise. By taking care of themselves, leaders can better manage the emotional demands of their job and continue to lead with empathy and compassion.

It's important for us to realize the toll that work can take on our emotional energy levels and make a conscious effort to replenish them before heading home. This can include taking short breaks throughout the workday to recharge, practicing mindfulness or meditation, engaging in physical exercise, or simply taking time to disconnect from work-related thoughts and worries.

By prioritizing our own emotional well-being, we can show up fully present and engaged for our loved ones and avoid unnecessary conflicts and stress at home. It's also important to communicate with our partners and families about our work-related responsibilities and stressors, so they can understand and support us in balancing work and home life.
