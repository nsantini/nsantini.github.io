In [this post](https://lethain.com/wardley-mapping/) Will Larson explains Wardley Maps in the context of refining Strategies. What's interesting is the core concepts of the maps: Users, Needs, and Capabilities. These are three items that should be identified for any Feature request.

Furthermore, in the maps those are linked, forming a Value Chain. When putting them together, multiple chains might converge in the same set of Capabilities, indicating their importance.

By capturing these three pieces of information, and creating the Value Chains, we can see if a request fits within our current world, and if it can make use of existing capabilities. Versus a one-off disjointed feature request that is not aligned with the rest of the product.
